Running experiments consist of running 2 scripts:
1) run_flowstar.py
2) run_comparision.py

Both of these operate on models given by pairs in the variable 'pairs', the
first model of the pair is the model without shrink wrapping and the second is
the one with shrink wrapping.
For example with the line:
  pairs = pairs + [('moore_rot_plain.model', 'moore_rot_sw_10.model')]
'moore_rot_plain.model' denotes the model without shrink wrapping and
'moore_rot_sw_10.model' denotes the model with shrink wrapping

1) run_flowstar.py
  runs on flowstar on all the files to generate the csv files (containing the 
  the variable interval, variable range and remainder term size for all the
  variables) in the directory ./csvs
  (some models are commented out, since running them takes a lot of time).
  
2) run_comparision.py
  a) Generates experiments.html file from all the csvs
  b) Generates images containing the interval boxes of the first variable up
     the point which both the model with shrink wrapping and the model without
     shrink wrapping managed to integrate to.
     
     
* The models are taken from 
https://ths.rwth-aachen.de/research/projects/hypro/benchmarks-of-continuous-and-hybrid-systems/
The continuous benchmarks are modified to have a fixed order.
The hybrid benchmarks are encoded as continuous ones by only taking the initial
mode and setting the intial conditions as the initial conditions for the hybrid
model.
